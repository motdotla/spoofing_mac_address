h1. Spoofing MAC Address

p. This is especially helpful at Panera during the hours they limit your internet access to 30 minutes.

h3. In Terminal do the following

ifconfig en1 | grep ether

Note your mac address. You will need it later if you want to change back to it (or you will have to reboot your mac.)

sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:e2:e3:e4:e5:e6
